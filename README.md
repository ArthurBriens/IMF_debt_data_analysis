# IMF_data_cleaning
Project to clean and analyze data drawn from the IMF's website and put it into perspective regarding the recent events. The data chosen here is the 'Public Finances in Modern History' as well as mining the data for insights on how finances evolve throughout history.
I aim to study debt dynamics throughout history, and try to think about what's next for the USA, as well as other economies.
